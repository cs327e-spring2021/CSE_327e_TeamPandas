COVID-19 Cases + American Community Survey

Interesting attributes:
- Irregular updates(that stem from a variety of reasons - see below) cause spikes in time data, because of this smoothing is often needed.
  - Some countries/states only report Monday-Friday causing Monday spikes (compared to areas who report on weekend)
  - Sometimes there issues uploading data and data is lost (October 10-11 for example in Florida)
- Retrospective reporting, there are instances where large numbers of historical cases or deaths have been reported on a single day. These reports cause anomalous spikes.
- Contains spatial data, could be useful in comparing Covid-cases in areas with different policies.
- U.S broken down into states
- UTC Standardized 
- Has information on # of cases, testing rates, # of hospitalization, fatalities

To combine the primary + secondary datasets
- We can combine on states since the primary has the Province_State field that corresponds to the given state and the secondary dataset has the ability to is divide census data by U.S. states

Insights we hope to gain:
- Comparing differnt demographics (age, education, income) to their respective covid case rates, testing rates or hospitalization rates
- Looking at these demographics across different states to see discrepancies between testing rates and hospitalization rates
Possible questions:
"Do education rates within different states affect number of cases and or testing?"
"Does income level (different indicators such as rent cost, income level, food stamps, etc) affect hospitalization or testing rate?"
